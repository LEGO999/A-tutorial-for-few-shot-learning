# A tutorial for few-shot learning
This is a supplementary code for the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE7eGew4eeg) in few-shot learning.
[My notes](https://lego999.github.io/ml/blog/2021/10/30/few_shot.html) with additional experiments are posted on my TechBlog.

## Prerequisites ##
```
python==3.6.9
torch==1.6.0
torchvision==0.7.0
numpy==1.19.5
tqdm==4.56.2
matplotlib==3.1.1
```
## Run ##
Download the pre-trained weight of ResNet-18 from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17fmN8eQdLpq2jIMQ_X0IXDPXfI9oVWgq/view). Rename it as ```resnet18.pt``` and put it into the folder ```state_dicts``` under the root directory of this repo.
Enjoy!
